## Project Overview
As the entertainment industry surges and major corporations dive into original video content, a new company is poised to enter the competitive world of movie-making. Recognizing the complexities of the film business, especially for newcomers, the company seeks to establish a strong foundation by understanding current box office trends and transforming these insights into a strategic roadmap for their new studio.

To ensure a successful start, the company has enlisted our help as Group 7 members to identify which types of films are currently performing well at the box office and translate these findings into actionable recommendations.

## Business Understanding
The Business objective is to identify which film genres will consistently bring in the most revenue for this new studio. There are many elements that contribute to a film's success and our goal is to analyze these factors through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and linear regression. This will allow us to uncover trends and connections that will guide the studio's production choices.

Ultimately, we want to translate these insights into actionable recommendations that will help the studio create films that captivate audiences and turn a profit.

## Objectives

### Main Objectives
1.To determine which types of films are performing best at the box office.<br>
2.To identify key factors that contribute to a film's success.

### Specific Objectives
1.Investigate key variables such as production budgets, domestic and worldwide gross revenues, release years, and genres.<br>
2.Develop predictive models to determine factors significantly impacting box office performance.<br>
3.To investigate the relationship between production budget and box office revenue.<br>
4.To examine the impact of release timing on a film's success.<br>
5.To provide data-driven recommendations for film production and release strategies.<br>

## Data Understanding
The data containsning information about various films, including their genres, budgets, box office revenues, movie ratings, and release dates.<br>
Understanding the structure and contents of our data will be the first step in uncovering the insights needed to guide our new movie studio's strategy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset. Key steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and visualizing distributions and relationships.

## Statistical Data Analysis


## Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is created to predict box office revenue based on factors such as budget, genre, and release timing. The model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
