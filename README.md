## Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a linear regression model to generate insights for a business stakeholder. Our company aims to enter the movie industry by creating original content, and this analysis will help us understand what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

## Business Understanding
The primary goal is to explore and identify the factors that contribute to a film's success at the box office. By analyzing current trends, we aim to provide actionable insights for the new movie studio.

## Objectives

### Main Objectives
- Determine which types of films are performing best at the box office.
- Identify key factors that contribute to a film's success.

### Specific Objectives
- Analyze the performance of different film genres.
- Investigate the relationship between production budget and box office revenue.
- Examine the impact of release timing on a film's success.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for film production and release strategies.

## Data Understanding
The dataset contains information about various films, including their genres, budgets, box office revenues, and release dates. Key variables include genre, budget, box office revenue, and release date.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset. Key steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and visualizing distributions and relationships.

## Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is created to predict box office revenue based on factors such as budget, genre, and release timing. The model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
